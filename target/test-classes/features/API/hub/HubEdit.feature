Feature: As an administrator (admin), I want to be able to update the information of the hub with the specified id number via the API connection.

  @Patch
  Scenario Outline: admin HUB Send a PATCH request to the api/hub/edit/{id} endpoint with valid authorization, correct id, and data
  (name, phone, address), verify that the response status code is 200, the message is 'Updated', and the id in the
  response body matches the id in the path. Then, confirm the update by sending a GET request to api/hub/{id} using
  the same id.

    * The api user sets "api/hub/edit" path parameters.
    # Api kullanicisi "api/hub/edit/{id}" path parametrelerini olusturur
    * The api user prepares a PATCH request containing "<name>", "<phone>" and "<address>" information to send to the api hubedit endpoint.
    # Api kullanicisi api hubedit endpointine gondermek icin "<name>", "<phone>" ve "<address>" bilgilerini iceren bir patch request hazirlar
    * The api user sends a "PATCH" request and saves the returned response.
    # Api kullanicisi PATCH request gonderir ve donen responsei kaydeder
    * The api user verifies that the status code is 200.
    # Api kullanicisi status codeun 200 oldugunu dogrular
    * The api user verifies that the "message" information in the response body is "Updated".
    # Api kullanicisi response bodydeki message bilgisinin "Updated" oldugunu dogrular
    * The api user verifies that the "data" "id" information in the returned response body is the same as the id path parameter written in the endpoint.
    # Api kullanicisi donen response body icindeki "data" "id" bilgisinin endpointde yazan id path parametresi ile ayni oldugunu dogrular
    * The api user verifies that the "name" is "Updated Hub" by sending a GET request to the "api" "hub" endpoint with the "data" "id" returned in the response body.
    # Api kullanicisi response bodyde donen "data" "id" ile "api" "hub" endpoint'ine GET request göndererek "name" bilgisinin "Updated Hub" oldugunu dogrular

    Examples:
      | name        | phone       | address              |
      | Updated Hub | 02589632141 | Updated Hub address. |
